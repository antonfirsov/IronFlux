IronFlux: Ruby || Python to C# compiler
========

IronFlux is an upcoming project with the goal of statically compiling Ruby and Python codebase to efficient, portable, DLR-free C#.

---------

Inspired by rubyflux (https://github.com/headius/rubyflux) and HPHPc.

Compilation is made by traversing AST-s provided by IronRuby and IronPython: https://github.com/IronLanguages/main
